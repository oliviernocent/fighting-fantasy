# Fighting Fantasy Companion App

As a fan of [Fighting Fantasy gamebooks](https://www.fightingfantasy.com/), I always dreamed of an app that could store my progression in the adventure and provide useful features like dice rolls, battle resolving, equipment management and so on.

Here it comes as a web application. All the data is recorded on the browser local storage: no account, no authentication but **you always have to use the same device**.
